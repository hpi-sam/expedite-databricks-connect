        This is code using classic spark that we want to rewrite to work with spark connect.
        The rewritten code should have exactly the same functionality as the original code and should return exactly the same output.
        This is the original code that does not work with spark connect:

        <code>
        {{code}}
        </code>

        When executed, the code produces the following error:
        {{error}}

        In case it is helpful you can use the following context to help you with the task:

        <context>
        {{context}}
        </context>

        Make sure to only return the rewritten code and nothing else.
