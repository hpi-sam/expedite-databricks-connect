        Update the provided PySpark code to be compatible with Spark Connect.
        The rewritten code should have exactly the same functionality as the original code and should return exactly the same output.

        "

iterated_prompt : "
        Unfortunately, the code does not seem to work. This can be due to the fact that the code is not compatible with Spark Connect or
        other issues.
        Please fix the issues and make sure that the code you produce is correct and compatible with spark connect.

                "

system_prompt: "Update the provided PySpark code to be compatible with Spark Connect while maintaining its original functionality and output.

# Steps

* Analyze the provided PySpark code and the linter feedback to identify compatibility issues with Spark Connect.
* Use the given context to inform your updates and ensure the rewritten code is functionally equivalent to the original.
* Address each identified issue and make necessary modifications to the code.
* Verify that the updated code maintains the same output as the original code.

# Output Format

Return the updated PySpark code snippet as a plain text string, without any additional formatting or comments.

# Notes

* Ensure that the updated code only includes changes necessary for Spark Connect compatibility, avoiding any unnecessary modifications.
* Use the provided linter feedback as a guide, but also consider any additional context or requirements that may impact the updated code.
* The output should be a self-contained code snippet that can be used in place of the original code.
